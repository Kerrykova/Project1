Team Members: Delayna Bradshaw, Kerry Kovacik, Michael Kung, Tito Odunsi

Project Description/Outline: 
Collect average income by zip code of 2011 compared to 2016 and calculate their rates of change. Collect crime rate volume by type and zip code for 2011 compared to 2016 and calculate their rates of change.

Research Questions to Answer: 
* How have incomes changed by zip code from 2011 to 2016 (5 year look)?
* How have crime rates changed by zip code from 2011 to 2016? All of Austin?
* Does age or population have an affect on income? or crime?
* Is there a correlation between income rates (increase or decrease) and amount of crime? Does type matter (ie: theft)?

Datasets to be used: Austintexas.gov, Census, Google Maps

Rough Breakdown of Tasks: 
* API request for crime data by zip code and type for 2011 and 2016.
* API request for income (household and per capita) for 2011 and 2016.
* Clean and merge data. 
* Create visualizations to answer research questions.
